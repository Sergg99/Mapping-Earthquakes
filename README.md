# Mapping_Earthquakes

  ## Project Overview: 
  
  In this analysis earthquake data was gathered using GeoJSON data from an API, created interactive maps displaying data through interactive filters, and created a scale in which events can be assessed according to their parameters

  ## Results:
  
  An interactive HTML map was generated in this exercise to provide the data visualization aspect of our analysis. The data can be filtered with intuitive checkboxes. The analysis was performed successfully. 
  
  ### Dark Mode:
  The map style provides the comfort of Dark Mode to be more user-friendly.

  ### Street Mode:
  The map style creates the perfect tools for you to explore routes that have been affected in the past.

  ### Satelite Mode:
  Satellite mode provides a more detailed experience of the data and what the affected locations look like.

Conclusion: 

MapBox is an excellent tool for analyzing and interpreting data. This exercise was challenging, Java Script is not an easy language, at least that is my opinion. 

The use of an API_KEY is required to access the following analysis. Make sure you maintain your API_KEY protected.
